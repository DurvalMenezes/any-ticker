any-ticker
==========

Extension of "golly-ticker" in Conway's "Game of Life"

## Introduction
This program enables us to make a ticker message, like [golly-ticker](https://code.google.com/p/vals-game-of-life/source/browse/trunk/src/main/resources/gameoflife/patterns/golly/Guns/golly-ticker.rle), which works under the rule of [Conway's Game of Life](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life).
Output file will be saved as [Life 1.06](http://conwaylife.com/wiki/Life_1.06). I recommend to open with [Golly](http://golly.sourceforge.net/)

## Motivation
To show **any** string or image as a **ticker** just like golly-ticker.

## How to use
You can simply use any-ticker by this command below in a temrminal.
`git clone https://github.com/potsbo/any-ticker.git && cd any-ticker && make`

## Future Works
* To make parameters modifiable by command line arguments
* To add a function to make a ticker from a black/white image

## Licence
Released under MIT licence.
